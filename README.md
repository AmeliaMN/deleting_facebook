# deleting_facebook
Documentation of what I'm doing to prepare to delete my Facebook account. 

Here are the steps I've already taken:

- [Downloaded my facebook data](https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992/?helpref=hc_fnav). This comes with a lot of data. Most importantly, all the photos I had uploaded to facebook over the years, organized by album, and a list of all my facebook friends. 
- [Posted on facebook](LeavingFacebook.txt) about my plan, announcing I'm starting a small (personal) newsletter, and giving a two-week countdown to get my affairs in order.
- [Parsed the HTML file of my friends list](FacebookFriends.Rmd). This HTML file is probably the least-useful way they could have provided the list of my friends, but with the help of [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) and [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) I was able to find the right elements to get a data frame. [Edit! I missed the option to dowload your data in JSON format, which is much easier to parse than the HTML. This would be my recommended method.]
- Made a google sheet of my entire friends list, as an accessible place for the data. 
- Went through the entire list categorizing how I knew people and how much I want to stay in contact. (This took several days, as I had over 600 facebook friends!)
- Exported my friends' birthdays from facebook. Facebook has changed their settings, so it's no longer easy to do this. But, [mobeigi has a python script](https://github.com/mobeigi/fb2cal) that will do it for you. As he warns, using this script made facebook temporarily suspend my account because of suspected security issues. I was able to get back in.

In progress:

- Parse birthday .ics file to save just the birthdays of people I want to stay in contact with. (I don't need 600+ birthday reminders on my calendar!)
- Make sure the Apps and Websites I used facebook to log in to have alterate modes of access. I've already adjusted my Goodreads settings, but it doesn't look like the facebook data download comes with the list of apps, so I need to dig into my settings. 

To do:

- Go through photos I'm tagged in and manually download pictures I want to keep
- Order prints of favorite photos
- Go through my google sheet again and make sure I have other modes of contact for the folks I want to stay in touch with
- Actually delete the account!!
- Clear cookies from my work computer, home computer, and phone


## What am I going to use instead? 

- I'm still going to be active on Twitter. I have a LinkedIn account. And, for right now I'm keeping Instagram. I know Instagram is owned by facebook, but it just feels like too much to delete IG right now. Baby steps!
- I'm starting a personal newsletter to send updates to my friends and family. I'm using [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/) for this.
- To keep up on local events, I'm planning to pay closer attention to local arts publications, like the [City Pages](http://www.citypages.com/) in the Twin Cities. 
- For events I'm hosting, I'll continue to use [Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/) to invite folks (I haven't used FB for event invites in a couple of years).
- Mostly, I'm going to be emailing, texting, calling, and talking face-to-face with my social network!
